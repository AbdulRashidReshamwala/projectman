ProjectMan is a project manager command line tool to easily save/open your favorite projects right from command line in your favorite text editor. 

Are you lazy to 'cd Desktop/projects/react/coolsite' and then open the folder in your favorite text editor? Add your favorite projects using `pm add` and open them anytime you want using `pm open`

---

## Installation

npm install -g projectman
```

## Commands

`pm` is an alias of `projectman` so you can use `pm <command>` or `projectman <command>`

### Open Project
```shell
pm open
```
or you can simply
```
pm
```
to open projects.

optionally you can also directly enter the name of your project as an argument 
```shell
pm open myProject
```

### Add project
```shell
cd /till/the/project
pm add
```

### Remove Project

Just do `pm remove` and select the project from the list
or do `pm remove <projectName>`


### Set Editor

```shell
pm seteditor
```
This will show you available options of text editors. You can select from them and get started!

*Note: This package will only work if your text editor supports command to open directory (e.g. VSCode has `code`, Sublime has `subl`)*

## ChangeLogs

#### v1.1.0 *[LATEST RELEASE]*

- Projects will not be erased after updating furthur (However they will be erased while installing this update so I'll recommend to take copy of your settings.json If you have added multiple projects already) (Sorry but this is the last time you would have to do this)
- Added `vim` in `pm seteditor` and added a message explaining 'How to set editors/IDE that are not listed in the menu'
- `pm` is now equivalent to `pm open`

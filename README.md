ProjectMan is a project manager command line tool to easily save open your favorite projects right from command line. 

Are you lazy to cd Desktop/projects/react/coolsite and then open the folder in your favorite text editor? Using project manager you can run `projectman open` or `pm open` and select the project and it will open it in your favorite text editor (default is set for vscode).

---

## Installation
```shell
npm install -g projectman
```
---

## Commands

`pm` is an alias of `projectman` so you can use `pm <command>` or `projectman <command>`

### Open Project
```shell
pm open

optionally you can also directly enter the name of your project as argument 
```shell
pm open myProject
```

*You might have to `sudo` while running add command as they need to write settings.json inside global npm directory*

## v1.1.0 [LATEST RELEASE]
```shell
npm install -g projectman
```

- Projects will not be erased after updating furthur (However it will still be erased while installing this update so I'll recommend to take copy of your settings.json If you have added multiple projects already)
- Added `vim` in `pm seteditor` and added a message explaining 'How to set editors/IDE that are not listed in the menu'
- `pm` is now equivalent to `pm open`

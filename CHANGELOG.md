**Issue :** [#5](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/projectman/issues/5) (Thank you [@feitzi](https://github.com/feitzi))

#### > Added `--for-project` flag in `pm seteditor`:
```shell
pm seteditor --for-project
```
This will allow users to set different editor for a specific project
E.g. Set Atom for `Project1` and have VSCode for other projects

**PR :** [#16](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/projectman/pull/16)

#### > `Other` option added in `pm seteditor` :
You can now select `other` option and type the editorCommand as an input rather than typing `pm seteditor [editorCommand]`

#### > New command `pm rmeditor`:
```shell
pm rmeditor
```
This will allow users to remove the project specific editors.
You can either `pm rmeditor` and choose the project to remove editor or `pm rmeditor --all` to remove all project specific editors.

## v1.1.0
```shell
npm install -g projectman@1.1.0
```
- ***Project specific editors*** (Thanks [#4](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/projectman/issues/4) [@fechy](https://github.com/fechy) for issue)
     - Now you can `pm edit` and set `editor` key in `settings.json` projects[] with the value of the command of your editor.
    -  `settings.json` E.g.
```js
{
    "commandToOpen": "code",
    "projects": [
        {
            "name":"MyCoolProject",
            "path":"/home/path/projects/mycoolproject",
            "editor":"vim"
        },
        {
            "name":"TwoProject",
            "path":"/path/something/project"
        }
    ]
}
```
This will allow users to open other projects in **VSCode** but use **Vim** to open `MyCoolProject`

- ***Projects will not be erased after updating furthur*** 
(However they will still be erased while installing this update so I'll recommend to take copy of your settings.json If you have added multiple projects already) (Sorry but this is the last time when you'll have to do this :cry: )) 
(Thank you [@codyaverett](https://github.com/codyaverett) and [@Tanuj69](https://github.com/Tanuj69) issue [#2](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/projectman/issues/2) and helping me out solving this)
- ***Added `vim` in `pm seteditor`*** 
also added a message explaining 'How to set editors/IDE that are not listed in the menu'
- `pm` is now alias for `pm open`
(Thank you [@johannesjo](https://github.com/johannesjo) for suggestion)
- **`pm seteditor [commandToOpenEditor]` added** 
This will set default editor command, This can be used when the editor you want to use is not listed in `pm seteditor`. (Note: `pm seteditor` will work exactly same as it did before)
